I chose these categories for this article because it discusses the importance of health professionals promoting tobacco cessation, counseling, and medication to help people quit smoking. The article also highlights the role of WHO in providing capacity building and training packages to support governments in establishing or strengthening their national tobacco cessation systems.

The two categories I chose reflect the fact that the article is primarily focused on quitting smoking (CEASE_SMOKING), but it also touches on improving mental health as part of a broader package of interventions. The target group's ability to change the habit is reflected by the fact that the article assumes that there are smokers who want to quit and are in need of help, which corresponds with the "Is at the initial stage of changing" category (3).

I chose these categories because the article is primarily about the importance of quitting smoking and how health professionals can promote tobacco cessation. The article mentions that brief advice from health professionals can increase quitting success rates by up to 30%, which implies that the individual has thought about changing their behavior (stage 2) but may need guidance or support to overcome their addiction (stage 4). Additionally, the article touches on the mental health aspects of smoking cessation, suggesting that improving one's mental health is closely tied to quitting smoking.

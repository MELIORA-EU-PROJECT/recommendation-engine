<h2>Directions</h2>
<h3>Black Bean Burgers</h3>
<ol>
<li>
    In medium bowl, stir together 1/2 cup rinsed well beans and 1 cup rice. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a food processor or blender, process the remaining beans and remaining rice, sweet potatoes, egg white, cumin, salt and pepper for 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
<li>Transfer the bean mixture to the bowl with the reserved beans and rice. Stir in the panko until well combined. Form into 6 patties.</li>
<li>In a medium nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat the bottom. Cook half of the patties for 4 minutes on both sides, or until slightly browned. Repeat with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and patties.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Mustard Potato Salad</h3>
<ol>
<li>
    Fill a medium heavy-duty pot three-fourths full with water. Add the potatoes.</li>
<li>Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork tender. Drain in a colander. Run under cold water to cool. Drain well.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, mustard, vinegar, pepper, and salt. Gently stir in the potatoes, green onions and parsley, tossing to coat. Serve with the burgers.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    Before working with a wet food mixture that needs to be formed into patties or a loaf, such as burgers or a meatloaf, run your hands under cold water to prevent the mixture from sticking to your hands.</li>
<li>Waxy potatoes, such as new potatoes or red potatoes, hold their shape best among the potato varieties, making them ideal for cold dishes like potato salad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keep it Healthy: </strong>Feeling creative? Experiment substituting different whole grains, such as couscous or quinoa, for the brown rice in these burgers. Also try using other legumes, such as kidney beans or cannellini beans, to replace the black beans in this recipe.</p>

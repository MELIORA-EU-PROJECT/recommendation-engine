You hear the phrase “Mediterranean diet” a lot when doctors talk about
heart-healthy eating. And with good reason: Its hallmarks — healthy fats
and plant foods — have been shown to be very beneficial to heart health.
But there’s a wide world of other international choices out there that
share these nutrition principles.</p>

<p>Mixing up the types of foods you eat can make your diet more interesting and help you stick longer and more easily to these life-changing principles, says Johns Hopkins registered dietitian Kathleen Johnson, M.A., R.D., L.D.N.</p>
<p>Try some of the following tasty, good-for-you choices that favorite ethnic cuisines have to offer.</p>
<h2>Mexican</h2>
<p>A staple of Mexican cooking is the tortilla. Start by choosing organic corn tortillas over wheat for more minerals and fiber. It’s also a smart choice for many people who are looking to lower their fat and sodium intake, Johnson says.</p>
<p>Select fish, chicken or vegetable dishes. Black beans are a great source of protein — pick them over refried beans.</p>
<p>For a topper, try a little guacamole. Avocado is a heart-healthy fat, and cilantro (a common spice in guacamole and Mexican dishes) is surprisingly full of antioxidants, Johnson says.</p>
<h2>Indian</h2>
<p>The abundance of vegetarian options makes it easy for heart-conscious diners to go out for Indian food. The warming spices they feature, such as turmeric and garam masala, are also anti-inflammatory, which is great for the heart.</p>
<p>Among the Indian dishes Johnson suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>lentil dal — lentils are a good source of protein</li>
<li>chickpea vindaloo</li>
<li>chana masala (made of chickpeas) and bhindi (okra)</li>
<li>rajma — it features kidney beans in a thick sauce</li>
<li>curries, of course — in addition to curries with classic spices, such as turmeric, you can find plenty of vegetarian options made with coconut milk</li>
</ul>
<h2>Japanese</h2>
<p>Fish dishes — hallmarks of the Japanese diet — are an excellent source of important omega-3 fatty acids for your heart. But be aware that Japanese foods can have a lot of sauce. “It’s best to ask for sauce on the side if you can,” Johnson suggests. Also choose brown rice over white for more heart-healthy fiber.</p>
<h2>Ethiopian/Moroccan/North African</h2>
<p>What these cuisines have in common is a lot of vegetable tagines, a type of stew named after the earthenware pot in which it’s cooked. “Ethiopian restaurants are a great place to take kids because they get to eat with their hands,” Johnson notes. Rather than utensils, the food is eaten with a flatbread made of teff flour, which is thought to help with blood-sugar management.</p>

It’s fun to experiment with international cooking right in your own
kitchen. Try looking at different types of ethnic cookbooks, suggests Johns
Hopkins dietitian Kathleen Johnson. One of her favorites: <em>Plenty</em>, by Israeli born chef Yotam Ottolenghi, which provides a fresh take on
preparing vegetables</p>

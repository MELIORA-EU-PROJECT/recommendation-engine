<p>
Is there a “best diet” to follow? Johns Hopkins cardiologist
Dr. Roger Blumenthal
answers this question and more.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Q:</strong>
What foods are good to boost your metabolism?
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A:</strong>
I do not believe in relying on a specific type of food to boost metabolism.
More important, people should try to increase their metabolism by
increasing physical activity. The muscles of the body are the engines that
burn calories, and using them will burn more calories.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Q:</strong>
How do I prevent bloating while I’m trying to eat healthy and lose weight?
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A:</strong>
There can be many reasons for bloating; constipation is one that comes to
mind. This can often be helped by increasing fiber in the diet and by
drinking more water or other low-calorie liquids. However, for weight loss,
try to avoid high-calorie drinks like soda or other sugar-sweetened beverages. Bloating can also be caused by
certain foods. Everyone knows about beans, but others that cause bloating
include broccoli, kale and cabbage.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Q:</strong>
What is the best diet?
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A:</strong>
The best diet is the one that works for you. However, as your question
suggests, we really have not figured that out yet; it may vary from person to person. There are many choices
but it seems like a well-balanced diet with carbs, fat and protein is a
good, healthy choice.
</p>
<p>
We have done a few studies suggesting that a low simple carbohydrate approach can be effective and safe in terms of blood glucose, insulin and cholesterol
levels, and people lost a moderate amount of weight. The key for each
person is finding a diet that they enjoy, that is easy to follow, and that
can be sustained over time to avoid regaining weight.
</p>
<p>
Also, it is important to increase daily physical activity. Many studies have
shown that physical activity is critical to help keep the weight off over
time.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Q:</strong>
I want to keep my size but tone my body. I know I need to exercise, but
I'm not sure where to start. Also, what foods should I eat?
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A:</strong>
Exercise guidelines recommend a combination of aerobic activities like
walking or cycling and also resistance training using weights, resistive
bands, or calisthenics. It is the resistance exercise that will help to
maintain your muscle tone and prevent muscle loss as you get older. You do
not have to eat anything special to maintain muscle tone — just do the
exercises.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Q:</strong>
I have heard that juicing is bad because it removes fiber. Is that true?
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A:</strong>
This is one of the downsides of juicing. You are leaving one of the key
components of the fruit behind — the fiber. In addition, the juice is very
highly concentrated with sugar. Overall, this is likely to be less filling
and therefore, many people end up increasing their daily calories if they
"over"-juice. It is better to eat the apple whole, including the skin,
rather than squeeze it and just drink the juice.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Q:</strong>
Are there specific fruits I should avoid if I am trying to lose weight?
</h3>
<p>
<strong>A:</strong>
Fruits can be a double-edged sword in a weight loss diet. Though they
contain many healthy nutrients, they are often very high in sugars.
Therefore, eating too much fruit can make it difficult to lose weight and
may even lead to weight gain.
</p>
<p>
For example, a banana has 100 calories and about 27 grams of carbohydrates.
An apple has about 115 calories and 30 grams of carbohydrates. Eating just
two bananas and two apples a day would provide more than 100 grams of carbohydrates. You
can do the math, but it becomes difficult to lose weight if the number of
carbohydrates starts creeping over 100 grams per day. A well-balanced diet
with carbs, protein and fat is a more sensible approach for most people.

<p>
    Physical exercise is vital for achieving and maintaining physical, heart
    and lung fitness. Health professionals agree that exercise doesnâ€™t have to
    be vigorous or excessively long in duration to be beneficial. In fact, they
    recommend moderate and balanced exercise routines. For example, people
    should strive for at least 30 minutes of moderate, uninterrupted physical
    activity on most days of the week (daily if possible).
</p>
<p>
    Health and fitness experts recommend participating in two types of exercise
    each week to achieve aerobic health and muscle strengthening. Muscle
    strengthening activities should be done twice a week and are designed to
    target the hips, legs, chest, back, arms, stomach and shoulders.

<p>
    Individuals with health conditions or concerns should consult their health
    care provider before starting an exercise program.

<p>Did you know that your kids are more likely to gain weight during the summer than while theyâ€™re in school?</p>
<p>Help your kids maintain a healthy weight this summer by keeping them active and trying some new healthy, kid-friendly recipes. This one provides 1 cup of vegetables per serving!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>12 small corn or flour tortillas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vegetable oil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 (16-ounce) can low-fat refried beans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/4 cup chopped onion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 (2-ounce) can diced green chili peppers (optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 tbsp red taco sauce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 cups chopped vegetables, such as broccoli, mushrooms, spinach, and bell peppers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Brush 1 side of each of 2 tortillas with water. Press the wet sides of the tortillas together to form a thick crust for the pizza. Brush the outside of the tortillas with a small amount of vegetable oil. Evenly brown both sides in a heated frying pan. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas. Set aside.</p>
<p>Heat refried beans, chopped onion, and half of the diced chili peppers together in a medium saucepan, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.</p>
<p>Spread about 1/3 cup of the bean mixture on each tortilla pizza. Sprinkle each pizza with 1 tablespoon taco sauce, then top with 1/2 cup chopped vegetables, 1 teaspoon of diced chili peppers (if desired), and 1 tablespoon of shredded cheese.</p>
<p>Return to frying pan and heat until cheese melts. Serve immediately.</p>

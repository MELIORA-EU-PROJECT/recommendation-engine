<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>(Gluten-free)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 14-1/2-ounce can of no-salt-added diced tomatoes, or 1-1/2 cups fresh chopped tomatoes, seeds and skin removed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tablespoon finely chopped red onion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>If using fresh tomatoes, chop to desired size. If using canned tomatoes, drain juice. (Petite-cut diced tomatoes are the ideal size for making bruschetta.) Mix all ingredients and refrigerate until ready to use, or use immediately. To make a dipping sauce, put it in a blender and blend on high about 10 seconds.</p>

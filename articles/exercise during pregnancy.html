<p>Regular exercise provides multiple health benefits during pregnancy. It can help reduce the symptoms of discomfort, manage certain prenatal health conditions and help with recovery after your baby is born. For example, exercise can be used as part of treatment for women with <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/adult/diabetes/gestational_diabetes_85,p00337/">gestational diabetes</a>, according to the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4515443/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>World Journal of Diabetes</em></a>.</p>
<p>Exercise is recommended for most women, regardless of their activity level prior to pregnancy. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, if you exercised and were physically fit before pregnancy, you can safely continue exercising throughout your pregnancy. If you were inactive before pregnancy, you can start exercising at a moderate pace. </p>
<p>Before beginning or continuing an exercise program during pregnancy, consult your health care provider or midwife for recommendations on safe activities and intensity levels. Certain complications and health conditions may limit your physical activity during your pregnancy.</p>

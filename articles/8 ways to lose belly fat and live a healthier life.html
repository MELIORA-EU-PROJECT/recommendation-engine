Maintaining a trim midsection does more than make you look great—it can
help you live longer. Larger waistlines are linked to a higher risk of
heart disease, diabetes and even cancer. Losing weight, especially belly
fat, also improves

<p>It’s impossible to target belly fat specifically when you diet. But losing weight overall will help shrink your waistline; more importantly, it will help reduce the dangerous layer of visceral fat, a type of fat within the abdominal cavity that you can’t see but that heightens health risks, says Kerry Stewart, Ed.D. , director of Clinical and Research Physiology at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>Here’s how to whittle down where it matters most.</p>
</div>
<div class="rtf">
<ol class="ol--large">
<li class=""><h2>Try curbing carbs instead of fats.</h2>
<p>When Johns Hopkins researchers compared the effects on the heart of losing
weight through a low-carbohydrate diet versus a low-fat diet for six
months—each containing the same amount of calories—those on a low-carb diet
lost an average of 10 pounds more than those on a low-fat diet—28.9 pounds
versus 18.7 pounds. An extra benefit of the low-carb diet is that it
produced a higher quality of weight loss, Stewart says. With weight loss,
fat is reduced, but there is also often a loss of lean tissue (muscle),
which is not desirable. On both diets, there was a loss of about 2 to 3
pounds of good lean tissue along with the fat, which means that the fat
loss percentage was much higher on the low-carb diet.</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Think eating plan, not diet.</h2>
<p>Ultimately, you need to pick a healthy eating plan you can stick to,
Stewart says. The benefit of a low-carb approach is that it simply involves
learning better food choices—no calorie-counting is necessary. In general,
a low-carb way of eating shifts your intake away from problem foods—those
high in carbs and sugar and without much fiber, like bread, bagels and
sodas—and toward high-fiber or high-protein choices, like vegetables, beans
and healthy meats.</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Keep moving.</h2>
<p>
Physical activity helps burn abdominal fat. “One of the biggest benefits of
exercise is that you get a lot of bang for your buck on body composition,”
Stewart says. Exercise seems to work off belly fat in particular because it
reduces circulating levels of
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_heart/eat_smart/8-ways-to-lose-belly-fat-and-live-a-healthier-life#definitions_block">
insulin
</a>
—which would otherwise signal the body to hang on to fat—and causes the
liver to use up fatty acids, especially those nearby visceral fat deposits,
he says.
</p>
<p>
The amount of exercise you need for weight loss depends on your goals. For
most people, this can mean 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous
exercise nearly every day.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Lift weights.</h2>
<p>
Adding even moderate strength training to aerobic exercise helps build lean
muscle mass, which causes you to burn more calories throughout the entire
day, both at rest and during exercise.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Become a label reader.</h2>
<p>
Compare and contrast brands. Some yogurts, for example, boast that they’re
low in fat, but they’re higher in carbs and added sugars than others,
Stewart says. Foods like gravy, mayonnaise, sauces and salad dressings
often contain high amounts of fat and lots of calories.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Move away from processed foods.</h2>
<p>The ingredients in packaged goods and snack foods are often heavy on trans
fats, added sugar and added salt or sodium—three things that make it
difficult to lose weight.</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Focus on the way your clothes fit more than reading a scale.
</h2>
<p>As you add muscle mass and lose fat, the reading on your bathroom scale may
not change much, but your pants will be looser. That’s a better mark of
progress. Measured around, your waistline should be less than 35 inches if
you’re a woman or less than 40 inches if you’re a man to reduce heart and
diabetes risks.</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Hang out with health-focused friends.</h2>
<p>
Research shows that you’re more apt to eat better and exercise more if your
friends and family are doing the same.

<strong>Insulin (in-suh-lin):</strong> A hormone made by the cells in your pancreas. Insulin
helps your body store the glucose (sugar) from your meals. If you have
diabetes and your pancreas is unable to make enough of this hormone, you
may be prescribed medicines to help your liver make more or make your
muscles more sensitive to the available insulin. If these medicines are not
enough, you may be prescribed insulin shots.</div>

<strong>Blood vessels (veh-suls):</strong> The system of flexible tubes—arteries,
capillaries and veins—that carries blood through the body. Oxygen and
nutrients are delivered by arteries to tiny, thin-walled capillaries that
feed them to cells and pick up waste material, including carbon dioxide.
Capillaries pass the waste to veins, which take the blood back to the heart
and lungs, where carbon dioxide is let out through your breath as you
exhale.</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<strong>Arteries (are-te-rease):</strong> The blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood
away from your heart for delivery to every part of your body. Arteries look
like thin tubes or hoses. The walls are made of a tough outer layer, a
middle layer of muscle and a smooth inner wall that helps blood flow
easily. The muscle layer expands and contracts to help blood move.

A diet that’s low in fat and carbohydrates can improve artery function,
according to a 2012 study by Johns Hopkins researchers. After six months,
those on the low-carb diet had lost more weight, and at a faster pace. But
in both groups, when weight was lost—and especially when belly fat
shrank—the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_heart/eat_smart/8-ways-to-lose-belly-fat-and-live-a-healthier-life#definition_block">arteries</a> were able to expand better, allowing blood to travel more freely. The study
shows that you don’t have to cut out all dietary fat to shrink belly fat.
For heart health, simply losing weight and exercising seems to be key.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<h3>Steak and Vegetable Skewers</h3>
<div class="flex-33-right"><img alt="text here" src="/-/media/images/health/3_-wellness/heart-health/01_aha/balsamic-steak-skewers-grill.jpg"/></div>
<ol>
<li>
    Soak 12 bamboo skewers for at least 10 minutes in cold water to keep them from charring or use metal skewers.</li>
<li>In a large resealable plastic bag or airtight container with a lid, mix together the beef, 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, rosemary, garlic, ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Seal tightly. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a food processor or blender, process the remaining 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, remaining ¼ teaspoon pepper, basil, 2 teaspoons oil, water and mustard for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
<li>On a skewer, thread a tomato, mushroom, bell pepper and zucchini. Repeat with 7 other skewers.</li>
<li>Thread the beef on the remaining 4 skewers. Discard the marinade.</li>
<li>Lightly coat the grates with cooking spray. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Put all the skewers on the grates. Grill the beef skewers for 12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the beef has reached the desired doneness when tested with an instant-read thermometer. Cook the vegetable skewers for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Transfer to a platter. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Leave the grill on medium-high heat to grill the potatoes.</li>
<li>When ready to serve, drizzle the vinaigrette over the vegetable skewers.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sweet Potatoes</h3>
<ol>
<li>
    While the skewers are grilling, in a large bowl, stir together the potatoes, 1 tablespoon oil, paprika, chili powder, and pepper until combined.</li>
<li>Place the sweet potatoes in a single layer, not overlapping, on the grill. Grill, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender, turning once halfway through. Serve with the beef and vegetable skewers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>No grill? No worries. Use your broiler instead. Broil the beef and vegetable skewers as directed and place the potatoes on a broiling rack.</li>
<li>Be sure to always spray grill grates with cooking spray before you preheat the grill.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keep it Healthy:</strong> Balsamic vinegars come in a variety of flavors, including white peach and cherry. Experiment with different ones by drizzling over vegetables or using in vinaigrettes or marinades.</p>

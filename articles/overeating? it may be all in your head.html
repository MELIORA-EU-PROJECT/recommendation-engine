With the ongoing
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/obesity">obesity</a>
epidemic in America, a new study from Johns Hopkins that provides a deeper
understanding of satiety — the sensation of fullness and satisfaction after
eating — could help point the way to new treatments for people prone to
overeating.
</p>
<p>
While investigating the brain’s memory and learning systems in mice,
scientists came across a particular type of brain cell that sends signals
to the body that when it comes to that extra helping, enough is enough.
</p>
<p>
“When the type of brain cell we discovered fires and sends off signals, our
laboratory mice stop eating soon after,” says
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/richard-huganir">Richard Huganir, Ph.D.</a>, director of the Department of Neuroscience at the
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/">
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</a>. “The signals seem to tell the mice they’ve had enough."

<h2>
A Surprising On/Off Switch for Appetite
</h2>
<p>
In examining these signals between nerve cells in the brain, Huganir, along
with graduate student Olof Lagerlöf, M.D., and other colleagues, focused on
a particular enzyme called OGT that is involved in how the body uses sugar
and
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes">insulin</a>. When they deleted the enzyme from the brains of mice, it effectively
removed the “off switch” to the animals’ appetites, and those mice began to
eat bigger meals and gain weight, mostly in the form of body fat.
</p>
<h2>
Getting the Message You’ve Had Enough to Eat
</h2>
<p>
With the mice now supersizing their portions at every turn, the researchers
wondered, were the brains of the mice not getting the message that they had
had enough to eat?
</p>
<p>
To test the theory, the researchers used light to stimulate these specific
brain cells. With the lines of communication now open, the formerly
overeating mice decreased their food consumption by 25 percent.
</p>
<p>
Glucose, the simple sugar that rises in the bloodstream after eating, plays
a role in how the brain enzyme works. After a meal, when the system is
working normally, it’s possible that a derivative of glucose helps OGT do
its job and activate the “I’m full” appetite shut-off mechanism.
</p>
<p>
“We believe we have found a new receiver of information that directly
affects brain activity and feeding behavior, and if our findings bear out
in other animals, including people, they may advance the search for drugs
or other means of controlling appetites,” says Lagerlöf.

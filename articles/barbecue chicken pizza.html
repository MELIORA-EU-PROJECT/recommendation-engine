<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 ready-made 12-inch-diameter thin pizza crust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 teaspoons olive oil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 cup sliced onion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 cup thin green or red pepper strips</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 cup cooked chicken, cut into small cubes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 cup bottled barbecue sauce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 cup shredded part-skim, low-moisture mozzarella cheese</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Preheat oven to 450°F. Heat oil in a frying pan and add onion and pepper strips. Fry over medium heat until soft, adding a little water instead of more oil if onion and pepper start to burn.</p>
<p>Add chicken and barbecue sauce. Stir and remove from heat. Place ready-made crust on cookie sheet. Spread chicken, onion, and pepper mix evenly on crust. Top with mozzarella. Bake for 10 minutes, watching carefully that cheese doesn't brown too much.</p>

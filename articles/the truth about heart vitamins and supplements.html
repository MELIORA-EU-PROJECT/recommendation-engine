If eating a heart-healthy diet is good for your heart, you might wonder if
taking vitamins and other nutritional supplements that are touted as
heart-healthy further protects you from cardiovascular disease.
</p>
<p>
“The bottom line is, we don’t recommend supplements to treat or to prevent
cardiovascular disease,” says Johns Hopkins physician
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0007779/edgar-miller">
Edgar R. Miller III, M.D., Ph.D.
</a>
, whose research review on the topic has been published in the    <em>Annals of Internal Medicine.</em> “The good news is, you don’t have to
spend any money on supplements.”</p>

<li class=""><h2>Vitamins and supplements don’t protect you from heart disease.
</h2>
<p>
Johns Hopkins researchers (including Miller) reviewed randomized clinical
trials involving hundreds of thousands of subjects, in which some were
given vitamins and others a placebo. “We found no evidence of benefits to
cardiovascular disease,” Miller says. “Supplements were ineffective and
unnecessary.”
</p>
<p>
One possible exception is omega-3 or fish oil capsules. This type of fatty
acid, found in fish and marine algae, helps the heart. Two servings of
fatty fish per week provides enough for most people. For those who don’t
get enough omega-3 in their diet, supplements may be helpful, Miller says.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Vitamins and supplements can be unsafe.
</h2>
<p>
While research has turned up no clear benefit to supplements, consuming too
much of certain vitamins can be harmful. Too much calcium and vitamin D are
associated with an <em>increased</em> risk of cardiovascular disease,
Miller says. Though studies are ongoing, there’s little evidence that any
amount of a vitamin D supplement will protect the heart, he adds.
</p>
<p>
Another risk is that what you see on the label isn’t always what you get.
Investigations have shown that too often pills said to contain medicinal
herbs are actually full of fillers like powdered rice or even dangerous
substances. Some don’t even contain <em>any</em> of the herbs on the
labels.
</p>
<p>
“Supplement production is not regulated by the FDA nor does the industry
need to prove health benefits, so they can use vague language like ‘good
for heart health’—but they can’t say ‘will lower blood pressure,’ ” Miller
says.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Food is the very best source of the nutrients your heart needs.
</h2>
<p>
Your body needs a range of vitamins to function properly—but they need to
come from food. Not only is there no proof of much benefit from
supplements, they also often contain unnaturally high doses of limited
types of nutrient compounds. There are more than 600 different types of
carotenoids (a type of antioxidant), for example. You’re far more likely to
get these antioxidants from a varied diet than a single pill.
</p>
<p>
“Food offers a full complement of the antioxidants you need, not just
selected ones in high doses,” Miller says.

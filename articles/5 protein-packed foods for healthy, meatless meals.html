<p>For most of us, eating a little less meat could have health benefits. Research indicates that a balanced diet low in saturated fats helps reduce your risk of developing heart disease and other chronic conditions.</p>
<p>And while white meats and fish are swaps for red meat, which tends to be high in unhealthy fats, meatless options contain important vitamins, minerals and fiber not found in chicken and fish. Johns Hopkins nutritionists recommend five foods — high in protein and other nutrients, but with no meat — and explain their health benefits.</p>

<li class=""><h2>Eggs
</h2>
<p><img alt="Brown eggs in a carton" src="/-/media/images/health/3_-wellness/womans-health/healthy-woman/eggs-2.jpg?h=375&amp;w=638&amp;hash=72E74DB2517328C3673F2B5BE96CED87" style="height: 375px; width: 638px;"/></p>
<p>Eggs are a great source of protein. And while in the past eggs had been
associated with increased heart disease risk, there’s actually substantial
evidence that for most people, eggs are not harmful. In general, eating a
whole egg every day is beneficial. However, if you have diabetes or heart
disease, keep your eggs to two or three a week.
</p>
<p>
No matter how you whip up your eggs, here are some other ways eating eggs
helps your body:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Breast health:</strong>
    Be sure to include the yolks in your egg dishes. They contain essential
    but hard-to-get nutrients such as choline, which helps lower rates of
    breast cancer.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Eyes:</strong>
    The antioxidants in eggs may prevent macular degeneration and
    cataracts.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Weight management:</strong>
    Studies have shown that if you eat eggs for breakfast, you may eat
    fewer calories during the day.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Meal suggestions:</em>
Keep hard-boiled eggs in the refrigerator for a quick snack, try an
egg-and-spinach omelet for breakfast or have a spinach salad with a
hard-boiled egg for dinner.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Tree Nuts
</h2>
<p><img alt="Assorted Tree Nuts in Mason Jars" src="/-/media/images/health/3_-wellness/womans-health/healthy-woman/nuts-2.jpg?h=376&amp;w=639&amp;hash=A0F38C5E7FA89A122E98011474AD2873" style="height: 376px; width: 639px;"/></p>
<p>
Tree nuts include walnuts, almonds and pecans — don’t confuse them with
peanuts, which are legumes. Tree nuts are high in protein, fiber and
heart-healthy fats. But remember, they are also high in calories so measure
your portions carefully. A handful of tree nuts (about one ounce) is a
healthy snack and helps with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cholesterol:</strong>
    Almonds have fiber, vitamin E and monounsaturated fat, which help lower
    harmful LDL cholesterol levels. Walnuts have omega-3 fatty acids, which
    are good for heart health and help lower high LDL levels.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Cancer:</strong>
    The vitamin E in tree nuts helps reduce the risk of breast, colon and
    prostate cancer. Brazil nuts contain selenium, an important mineral for
    reducing the risk of cancer.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Brain health:</strong>
    The omega-3 in walnuts also boosts brain health.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Skin:</strong>
    The vitamin E and monounsaturated fats help promote healthier skin.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Meal suggestions:</em>
Sprinkle nuts over a salad, stir into an omelet, drop a handful into a
frittata or pack a handful in your lunch as a quick snack.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Legumes
</h2>
<p><img alt="Many varieties of dried legumes in tiled pattern" src="/-/media/images/health/3_-wellness/womans-health/healthy-woman/legumes-2.jpg?h=375&amp;w=639&amp;hash=3F0CEDF27705094F2D98299C34174B20" style="height: 375px; width: 639px;"/></p>
<p>
Legumes include a range of beans and peas such as black beans, chickpeas
and lentils. They’re loaded with protein, fiber and many key nutrients
including calcium, potassium, magnesium and iron. Don’t let their small
size fool you. They pack a powerful health punch for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Diabetes and cholesterol:</strong>
    The fiber in legumes does double duty. It helps stabilize blood sugars,
    which is good for those with diabetes, and helps lower cholesterol.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Cancer:</strong>
    Legumes are full of antioxidants, meaning they help reduce cancer risk.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Weight management:</strong>
    The fiber in legumes also helps you feel fuller faster, which may help
    prevent overeating.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Meal suggestions:</em>
Add to salads, stuffed baked potatoes and vegetarian chili, or puree for a
sandwich spread. If you’re getting beans in a can, look for a label that
says “no sodium added.” Otherwise, be sure to rinse canned beans well in
water since they’re usually packed in a high-sodium liquid.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Soy
</h2>
<p><img alt="Farmer holding soy bean seeds in field" src="/-/media/images/health/3_-wellness/womans-health/healthy-woman/soy-beans-2.jpg?h=375&amp;w=639&amp;hash=54E660E696C6244A141C0B0B90AF1680" style="height: 375px; width: 639px;"/></p>
<p>
Whole soy foods, such as edamame, tofu, tempeh, soy milk and soy nuts, are
great sources of lean protein. Unlike most vegetarian proteins, soy is a
complete protein, providing all the essential amino acids for optimal use
by your body. Processed soy ingredients, such as those found in bars and
snack foods, leave out many nutritional components. So stick with whole soy
to get the best nutritional value and to reap maximum health benefits such
as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Heart health and cholesterol:</strong>
    Soy is plant-based so it’s low in saturated fat and cholesterol-free.
    Some research suggests that soy may help lower cholesterol levels.
    Folate, vitamins B6 and B12, calcium, magnesium and potassium, all
    found in soy, help lower your risk of heart disease.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Hair, teeth, bones:</strong>
    With its folate and vitamins B6 and B12, soy nourishes your scalp, hair
    follicles and growing hair. The calcium in soy helps keep teeth and
    bones strong.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Mood, PMS, migraines:</strong>
    Folate contributes to serotonin levels, so soy may help boost your
    mood. Vitamin B6 and calcium may ease premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
    symptoms, and magnesium may help decrease migraines.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Weight management:</strong>
    The nutrients in soy help you maintain a healthy weight and increase
    your lean muscle mass.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Meal suggestion:</em>
For a healthy, 100-calorie snack, boil 1/2 cup of edamame. When cooled,
sprinkle with a touch of sea salt. This is a mindful snack since you have
to pinch the pods to remove the bean, allowing time to appreciate your
food.
</p></li>
<li class=""><h2>Yogurt
</h2>
<p><img alt="Woman's hands holding yogurt with fruit on top" src="/-/media/images/health/3_-wellness/womans-health/healthy-woman/yogurt-2.jpg?h=375&amp;w=640&amp;hash=CB2789772FE612D4A5051EC779747A14" style="height: 375px; width: 640px;"/></p>
<p>
Your gastrointestinal tract — and your taste buds — can benefit from
yogurt. When planning meals, remember that Greek yogurt is higher in
protein, regular yogurt is higher in calcium and kefir (a yogurt-like
drink) is higher in probiotics. No matter what your preference of yogurt
flavors or styles, you can enjoy these benefits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Digestive health:</strong>
    Yogurt helps maintain the billions of good bacteria you need for a
    healthy digestive and immune system. Plus, the bacteria in yogurt help
    the body break down and absorb critical nutrients.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Bone health:</strong>
    The calcium and protein in yogurt help make bones strong.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Meal suggestion:</em>
Mix a handful of almonds into yogurt for a healthy snack.
</p>
<p>
It’s always a good idea to talk to your primary care physician or a
nutritionist as you start adding — or subtracting — foods to or from your
diet.
